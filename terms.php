These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service. Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms.</p>
        <h2>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h2>
        <p>Mpingo TV is a web-based platform that provides users with access to football match schedules, scores, and related data ("Content"). The Content is aggregated from third-party sources, primarily the Sofascore API. The Service is provided for personal, non-commercial use only. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</p>

        <h2>3. USE OF THE SERVICE</h2>
        <p>You agree to use the Service only for purposes that are permitted by these Terms and any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions. You agree not to engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Service (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).</p>
        <h3>User Conduct</h3>
        <p>You agree not to use the Service to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, trade, or resell the Content for any commercial purpose.</li>
            <li>Use any automated system, including without limitation "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Site or its related systems or networks.</li>
            <li>Scrape, data-mine, or otherwise extract data from the Site for any purpose not explicitly permitted.</li>
            <li>Introduce any viruses, trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A breach or violation of any of the Terms will result in an immediate termination of your Services.</p>
        <h2>4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
        <p>The Site and its original content (excluding Content provided by third parties), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of Mpingo TV and its licensors. The visual interfaces, graphics, design, compilation, information, data, computer code, and all other elements of the Service are protected by intellectual property and other laws. The name "Mpingo TV", our logos, and the overall look and feel of the site are our trademarks and may not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without our prior written permission.</p>
        <p>The sports data, including team names, logos, and league information, is the intellectual property of their respective owners (e.g., Sofascore, sports leagues, teams). We use this content under the assumption that it is made available for public, non-commercial use by the API provider. We do not claim any ownership over this third-party content.</p>
        <h2>5. DISCLAIMERS</h2>
        <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
        <p>WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Service will meet your requirements.</li>
            <li>The Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free.</li>
            <li>The results that may be obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate or reliable. The data is provided by a third party, and we cannot guarantee its accuracy, completeness, or timeliness.</li>
            <li>The quality of any products, services, information, or other material obtained by you through the Service will meet your expectations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any reliance you place on such information is therefore strictly at your own risk.</p>
        <h2>6. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL MPINGO TV, NOR ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, OR AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.</li>
            <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the Service.</li>
            <li>Any content obtained from the Service.</li>
            <li>Unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>7. INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
        <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Mpingo TV and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of a) your use and access of the Service, or b) a breach of these Terms.</p>
        <h2>8. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the website owner is based, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.</p>
        <h2>9. CHANGES TO TERMS</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
